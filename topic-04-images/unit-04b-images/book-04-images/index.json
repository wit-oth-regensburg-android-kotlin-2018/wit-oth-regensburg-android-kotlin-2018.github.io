See if you can change this to 'Save Placemark'. This is only to be changed if PlacemarkActivity is launched with a placemark passed to it. Make sure the `Save Placemark` string is externalized (in strings.xml)\n\n\n## Exercise 2 Solution\n\n## strings.xml\n\n~~~\n  <string name=\"save_placemark\"> Save Placemark </string>\n~~~\n\n\n## PlacemarkActivity\n\n~~~\n  if (intent.hasExtra(\"placemark_edit\")) {\n      ...\n      btnAdd.setText(R.string.save_placemark)\n    }\n~~~\n\n## Exercise 3 \n\nWhen you select a placemark from PlacemarkListActivity - it presents the activity in the PlacemarkActivity. If you press 'Save Activity' - a new activity is created and appended to the list.\n\nChange this behaviour such that the button should update the existing placemark with the newly entered values, not create a new one.  We have new features in PlacemarkStore to enable you to implement this (the update method). Essentially, you will need to call update OR create when handling the button event.\n\nIf you complete the implementation, you will notice that even if you update a Placemark's contents, the new contents will not be displayed in PlacemarkList. However, if you consult the logs you may be able to see if the values are actually changed.  \n\n## Exercise 3 Solution\n\nIntroduce a local flag in onCreate(), always initialised to false:\n\n## PlacemarkActivity\n\n~~~\n    var edit = false\n~~~\n\nSet the flag to true if we have a placemark passed:\n\n~~~\n    if (intent.hasExtra(\"placemark_edit\")) {\n      edit = true\n      placemark = intent.extras.getParcelable<PlacemarkModel>(\"placemark_edit\")\n      placemarkTitle.setText(placemark.title)\n      description.setText(placemark.description)\n      btnAdd.setText(R.string.save_placemark)\n    }\n~~~\n\nThen rework the add button event handler to follows:\n\n~~~\n    ...\n    btnAdd.setOnClickListener() {\n      placemark.title = placemarkTitle.text.toString()\n      placemark.description = description.text.toString()\n      if (placemark.title.isEmpty()) {\n        toast(R.string.enter_placemark_title)\n      } else {\n        if (edit) {\n          app.placemarks.update(placemark.copy())\n        } else {\n          app.placemarks.create(placemark.copy())\n        }\n      }\n      info(\"add Button Pressed: $placemarkTitle\")\n      setResult(AppCompatActivity.RESULT_OK)\n      finish()\n    }\n    ...\n~~~"

The view should look like this now:\n\n![](img/01.png)\n\nTake some time to look at the `Design` view in studio:\n\n![](img/02.png)\n\nRemove the controls again - and this time add them using the pallette - dragging and dropping the button + imageView widgits to achieve the same effect. You will notice, however, that we have a set of additional parameters included in our hand coded xml above.\n\nWe can add an event handler for the new button:\n\n## PlacemarkActivity\n\n~~~\n    chooseImage.setOnClickListener {\n      info (\"Select image\")\n    }\n~~~\n\nNote that this is `inside` the onCreate method.

    "contentMd" : "# Selecting Images\n\nWe will be supporting the selection of images from the phones gallery/photos. There are APIs in android for this purpose. Since Android 4.4, this has been centralised into the Storage Access Framework:\n\n- <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider>\n\nThis is part of a larger `Content Provider` architecture - and serves a much broader remit than just accessing photos. We will try to simplify usage of the framework, by encapsulating it in a `helper` class\n\nCreate a package called `org.wit.placemark.helpers`, and incorporate this file into the package:\n\n## ImageHelpers.kt\n\n~~~\npackage org.wit.placemark.helpers\n\nimport android.app.Activity\nimport android.content.Intent\nimport org.wit.placemark.R\n\nfun showImagePicker(parent: Activity, id: Int) {\n  val intent = Intent()\n  intent.type = \"image/*\"\n  intent.action = Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT\n  intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)\n  val chooser = Intent.createChooser(intent, R.string.select_placemark_image.toString())\n  parent.startActivityForResult(chooser, id)\n}\n~~~\n\nThis function relies on this new string in strings.xml:\n\n## strings.xml\n\n~~~\n<string name=\"select_placemark_image\">Select placemark image</string>\n~~~\n\nNotice that this is just a function, not a class or an object. Its purpose is to show an image picker dialog.\n\nWe will now trigger this dialog. When starting an activity like this, we usually define a special code - which we will expect the new activity to send back when it is finished (otherwise we might get confused as to which activity has just finished).\n\nHere is the id we invent - make it a class member of PlacemakerActivity:\n\n## PlacemakerActivity\n\n~~~\n  val IMAGE_REQUEST = 1\n~~~\n\nThen to trigger the picker:\n\n~~~\n    chooseImage.setOnClickListener {\n      showImagePicker(this, IMAGE_REQUEST)\n    }\n~~~    \n\nIf there are no images in your simulator, you might want to launch a browser, find some images and save them to your camera roll (long press in chrome will trigger this).\n\nRun the app now and verify that the picker does in fact appear, presenting a set of images for selection.\n\n![](img/03.png)\n\nThe images will not go anywhere as yet."

This is via a lifecycle event - triggered when an activity we may have started finishes:\n\n\n## PlacemarkActivity\n\n~~~\n  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)\n    when (requestCode) {\n      IMAGE_REQUEST -> {\n        if (data != null) {\n          placemark.image = data.getData().toString()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n~~~\n\nNotice how we are recovering the name only when the IMAGE_REQUEST is seen.\n\nSee if you can run the application under debug - and place a breakpoint in where the image names is recovered above. See if you can inspect the name.\n\nIn order to display the image, we introduce another helper :\n\n\n## Imagehelpers\n\n~~~\nfun readImage(activity: Activity, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?): Bitmap? {\n  var bitmap: Bitmap? = null\n  if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK && data != null && data.data != null) {\n    try {\n      bitmap = MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(activity.contentResolver, data.data)\n    } catch (e: IOException) {\n      e.printStackTrace()\n    }\n  }\n  return bitmap\n}\n~~~\n\nFinally, we can use this method to display the image in the image view:\n\n## PlacemarkActivity\n\n~~~\n      IMAGE_REQUEST -> {\n        if (data != null) {\n          placemark.image = data.getData().toString()\n          placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImage(this, resultCode, data))\n        }\n~~~\n\nRun this now, and the selected image should be displayed in the view.\n\n![](img/04.png)"
